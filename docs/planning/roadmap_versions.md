# ðŸ§­ Roadmap Version Snapshots

This folder contains **timestamped snapshots** of the canonical `01_roadmap.md`.  
Each snapshot locks in the roadmap at a specific milestone or before a major architectural shift.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Usage Rules

- Snapshots are **immutable**. Once created, do not edit.
- Snapshots are created:
  - Before starting a new roadmap phase
  - After finalizing a new architectural rule
  - Before merging a major feature branch
- Filenames must follow this convention:

roadmap_phase_{PHASE_ID}_{YYYY-MM-DD}.md

yaml
Copy
Edit

âœ… Example:
roadmap_phase_X0_2025-05-24.md

yaml
Copy
Edit

---

## ðŸ“Œ Enforcement

- `scripts/end_dev.py` must copy `01_roadmap.md` here automatically if `PHASE:` or `Outcome:` blocks have changed.
- `scripts/update_docs.py` should include this snapshot creation as part of its lifecycle.
- `start_dev.py` should warn if the current roadmap does not match the last locked version.

When you have snapshots, regenerate this section:
